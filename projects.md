## [2022-11 â€¢ Random Generator](https://gwenmurphy.github.io/projects/Random-Generator/)

> In the office, there was a sweepstakes taking place centered around the Football World Cup that was about to start in Qatar. Someone had put forward several days before the idea for an office sweepstakes, and his plan to randomly draw was to write the list of countries and names on pieces of paper and put them into tupperware containers sorted either by country or name, with the intention of picking one from one and one from the other.
>
> I found that to be comparatively Flintstonian, so I decided to create that process in Python and commit it to a GitHub repository. I managed to complete it, but the person who had the list was not present and the list could not be found, so I had to fill it with random strings so both arrays had an equal amount (32).
>
> The backend has been completed, but it does not currently have a frontend, which was put forward at the suggestion of my boss. It may be some time before one is put together.
