Hi, I'm Gwen! I'm an Apprentice IT Technician from the United Kingdom.

My interests are varied. They include anime (specifically shows such as Sailor Moon and Kakegurui); films (such as John Wick, the MCU, and the 2019 Charlie's Angels to name a few); and television (shows such as Star Trek, The Expanse, Money Heist, The Walking Dead, etc.). I am also interested in computers and I have a couple of Raspberry Pi's lying around that I use for personal projects of mine and for self-hosting a few things I find handy. I also like watching the rugby, especially if it's Wales winning in the Six Nations.

I am currently learning Welsh and French on Duolingo, albeit to varying levels of success and at a rather slow pace since linguistics is not my strong suit. I am also learning Python.

I have already put together at least one project together in Python and I've written about it on the [Projects page]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/) of my site if you wish to have a look.
