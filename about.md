Hi, I'm Gwen! I'm an Apprentice IT Technicial from the United Kingdom.

### Interests

My interests are varied. They include anime, films, television, gaming, and fanfiction.

I enjoy watching anime, especially if it is shows such as &nbsp;<span class="notranslate">Sailor Moon</span>&nbsp; and &nbsp;<span class="notranslate">Kakegurui</span>&nbsp;. Of all the anime shows that I like, &nbsp;<span class="notranslate">Sailor Moon</span>&nbsp; is my favourite by quite some margin.

I am also interested in films, though I like only certain genres. I am a fan of the Marvel films, the John Wick films, and many others including the 2019 film &nbsp;<span class="notranslate">Charlie's Angels</span>&nbsp;. That film is my joint-1st favourite film of 2019 alongside &nbsp;<span class="notranslate">Avengers: Endgame</span>&nbsp;.

I am also interested in television, though I lean quite a bit towards science fiction shows such as &nbsp;<span class="notranslate">The Expanse</span>&nbsp; and the various &nbsp;<span class="notranslate">Star Trek</span>&nbsp; shows. &nbsp;<span class="notranslate">Voyager</span>&nbsp;, &nbsp;<span class="notranslate">Discovery</span>&nbsp;, and &nbsp;<span class="notranslate">Picard</span>&nbsp; are my personal favourites.

I am also interested in computers and I have a couple of &nbsp;<span class="notranslate">Raspberry Pi 4B's</span>&nbsp; handy that I like to use for personal projects of mine. As of writing, I use them to self-host a few things I think I'll find handy. I'll admit, I had to consult various guides to get it working, but I managed it.

I also like watching the rugby, especially if it's Wales winning in the Six Nations.

### What am I doing these days?

I am currently learning Welsh and French on &nbsp;<span class="notranslate">Duolingo</span>&nbsp;, though given that linguistics is not my strong suit, I am doing so with varying levels of success and at a rather slow pace.

I am also learning Python, and I have already put together at least one project in Python, which I have written about on the [Projects page]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/) of my site if you wish to browse them.
