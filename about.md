### Who am I?

I am Gwen.
Pronouns are she/her.

### What are my interests?

I enjoy gaming, especially such games such as Grand Theft Auto V (and Grand Theft Auto Online), World of Warships, and Star Trek Online. I also enjoy watching anime, with my favourites being Sailor Moon and Kakegurui. I also enjoy watching films. I am a fan of the MCU films, the John Wick films, and the 2019 film Charlie's Angels. I also enjoy watching the Six Nations, especially when Wales is winning.

I enjoy working on [personal projects of mine]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects), which includes [a Twitter bot]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/Lesbian-Wednesday-Addams-Twitter-Bot) that runs on a Raspberry Pi 4B.

I enjoy listening to music as well. My musical interests are all over the place, but I am a fan of Billie Eilish, Sabaton, Gorillaz and Babymetal. With the exception of Gorillaz, I've got their music on LPs; and with the exception of Sabaton, I've got their music on CDs.

### Am I learning any languages?

I'm also learning Welsh and French on Duolingo, partially because being monolingual sounds a bit boring, partially because there was [some really good show on Netflix](https://www.google.com/search?q=el+ministerio+del+tiempo) that disappeared a while back and the only way for me to watch it is to learn the language it's in to an advanced level (amazed why I'm not doing said language on Duolingo for some reason), and partially because the memes ascribe John Wick-like abilities to that green owl and I very much like to sleep with both my eyes closed.

### What about programming languages?

I'm also learning Python, because I can. It's the language I coded the Twitter bot in. Most of my projects may end up being in Python.
