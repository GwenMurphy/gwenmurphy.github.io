Hi, I'm Gwen! I'm an Apprentice IT Technicial from the United Kingdom.

### Interests

My interests are varied. They include anime, films, television, gaming, and fanfiction.

I enjoy watching anime, especially if it is shows such as Sailor Moon and Kakegurui. Of all the anime shows that I like, Sailor Moon is my favourite by quite some margin.

I am also interested in films, though I like only certain genres. I am a fan of the Marvel films, the John Wick films, and many others including the 2019 film Charlie's Angels. That film is my joint-1st favourite film of 2019 alongside Avengers: Endgame.

I am also interested in television, though I lean quite a bit towards science fiction shows such as The Expanse and the various Star Trek shows. Voyager, Discovery, and Picard are my personal favourites.

I am also interested in computers and I have a couple of Raspberry Pi 4B's handy that I like to use for personal projects of mine. As of writing, I use them to self-host a few things I think I'll find handy. I'll admit, I had to consult various guides to get it working, but I managed it.

I also like watching the rugby, especially if it's Wales winning in the Six Nations.

### What am I doing these days?

I am currently learning Welsh and French on Duolingo, though given that linguistics is not my strong suit, I am doing so with varying levels of success and at a rather slow pace.

I am also learning Python, and I have already put together at least one project in Python, which I have written about on the [Projects page]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/) of my site if you wish to browse them.
