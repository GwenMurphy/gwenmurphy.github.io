I am classing this as a work-related project, because of the circumstances in which it arose. At last, an idea had been put together!

The circumstances in question was that there is, as of original publication of this page (November 17th, 2022), a sweepstakes concerning the Football World Cup taking place in Qatar. The IT Department (myself) overheard the original plan for the draw, which was comparatively Flintstonian and involved cutouts of paper with names and countries written on, plus two pieces of tupperware. This prompted me to find an automated solution, which was coded that same day.
