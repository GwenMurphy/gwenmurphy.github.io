A couple of months ago, I started looking into whether I could create a Twitter bot. I had spent some time on it, eventually stumbling across a few videos on the topic. Given that I had a couple of Raspberry Pi's lying around, I decided to put one of them to use. From there, I found a tutorial bosted on GitHub detailing how ot create one, and I followed it. Fortunately, the account that i wanted ot choose for it had been created a fe months ago by yours truly.

I spent quite some time in October working on it and making what improvements I could with the intention of putting it into active use on Halloween 2022, which is a goal I managed to achieve. It's not perfect, but it works, and I am kinda proud of it. Getting the error catching the way I want it to work such that if a tweet is too long or is a duplicate, it prints a certain string that tells me which tweet it was that caused it.

I am still making improvements on it when I can. The bot itself can be found at <a href="https://twitter.com/WednesdayAd2ams/" target="_blank">@WednesdayAd2ams</a>.
