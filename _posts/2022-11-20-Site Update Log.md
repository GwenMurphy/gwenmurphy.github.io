#### 2022-11-23 13:20 • Cosmetic Changes to Site

I've cosmetically changed the site by increasing the width in the <em>.container</em> tag in the styles.css file. It has been moved from 740px to 1000px. Although it is a small change, it seems to be having a big impact on how content is displayed on the site. This should be particularly helpful when it comes to displaying content pertaining to my projects within iframe tags. I have had a look at the site after the cosmetic changes and I like it enough that I will be making the same edits to my personal site in due course.

#### 2022-11-21 20:20 • Contact Form Added

I have added a contact form to the site should it be needed.

#### 2022-11-21 19:09 • Blog Posts Consolidated

The blog posts have been consolidated such that there only exists one blog post for logging the updating of the site, namely this one.

#### 2022-11-21 16:42 • About Page Written

The About page has been written.  It will likely be updated in the future to make it look better.

#### 2022-11-20 01:10 • Minor Site Updates

I have done some minor updates to the website, mainly the addition of categories to the post and the visibility of the time of day in blog posts.

 I have done the same on <a href="https://gwenthewelshgal.github.io/" target="_blank">my personal GitHub site</a> while listening to the sounds of Django Django. I've included the song below if you're curious.

The health and safety guy at the office is really into prog rock. Odds are he'd like Django Django too. I found them because of GTA V since their song "Waveforms" plays on one of the radio stations<a id="bottom">.</a>
