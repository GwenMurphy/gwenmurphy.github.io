title: Random Number Generator
---

I've been casually tasked with greating a random generator, the premise of which is that there's an office sweepstakes going on for the 2022 Football World Cup taking place in Qatar. Each person in the draw is to be assigned to a team and measures will need to be put in place such that once a person and team have been picked, they are removed from their respective arrays.

Coding it in Python is far superior to the original plan which involved someone grabbing pieces of paper from pieces of tupperware and wishing for a bit of luck like it's some sort of medieval lottery. Once it has been completed, this post will be amended.
