I've been casually tasked with greating a random generator, the premise of which is that there's an office sweepstakes going on for the 2022 Football World Cup taking place in Qatar. Each person in the draw is to be assigned to a team and measures will need to be put in place such that once a person and team have been picked, they are removed from their respective arrays.

Coding it in Python is far superior to the original plan which involved someone grabbing pieces of paper from pieces of tupperware and wishing for a bit of luck like it's some sort of medieval lottery.

As of November 17th, 2022, the backend has been completed. My boss immediately suggested a frontend, but that's his strong suit. The project itself now has its own page on this site, appropriately named "[Random Generator](https://gwenmurphy.github.io/projects/Random-Generator/)."
